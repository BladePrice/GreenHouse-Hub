This will be the journey of the creation of my GreenHouse. Final stage will be a four shelved green house, each shelf will have independently controlled lights and an auto watering system that utilizes humidity (maybe) and soil moisture sensors. An Arduino Leonardo will handle the physical controlling of the components and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W will host a local front end webpage to allow monitoring and changing of settings; allowing the Pi to be the clock of the system.
